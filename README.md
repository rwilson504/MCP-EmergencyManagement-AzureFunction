<!-- Introduction: what this MCP server is dedicated to -->
## Introduction

Address parsing is not rocket surgery!

Free and simple API to integrate parsing of unstructured United States addresses into your applications.

---

This MCP server is dedicated to helping developers:

- Parse unstructured address data
- Format addresses based on USPS guidelines
- Use a hosted API with no software to install or update
- Integrate easily with minimal setup

Use this server to normalize and validate free-form US addresses before storing, displaying, or sending them to downstream systems.

# Getting Started with Remote MCP Servers using Azure Functions (.NET/C#)

This is a quickstart template to easily build and deploy a custom remote MCP server to the cloud using Azure functions. You can clone/restore/run on your local machine with debugging, and `azd up` to have it in the cloud in a couple minutes.  The MCP server is secured by design using keys and HTTPs, and allows more options for OAuth using EasyAuth and/or API Management as well as network isolation using VNET.

Below is the architecture diagram for the Remote MCP Server using Azure Functions:

![Architecture Diagram](architecture-diagram.png)

## Prepare your local environment

An Azure Storage Emulator is needed for this particular sample because we will save and get snippets from blob storage. 

1. Start Azurite

    ```shell
    docker run -p 10000:10000 -p 10001:10001 -p 10002:10002 \
        mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite
    ```

>**Note** if you use Azurite coming from VS Code extension you need to run `Azurite: Start` now or you will see errors.

## Run your MCP Server locally from the terminal

1. From the `src` folder, run this command to start the Functions host locally:

    ```shell
    cd src
    func start
    ```

Note by default this will use the webhooks route: `/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse`.  Later we will use this in Azure to set the key on client/host calls: `/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse?code=<system_key>`

## Connect to the *local* MCP server from within a client/host

### VS Code - Copilot Edits

1. **Add MCP Server** from command palette and add URL to your running Function app's SSE endpoint:
    ```shell
    http://0.0.0.0:7071/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse
    ```
1. **List MCP Servers** from command palette and start the server
1. In Copilot chat agent mode enter a prompt to trigger the tool, e.g., select some code and enter this prompt

    ```plaintext
    Say Hello 
    ```

    ```plaintext
    Save this snippet as snippet1 
    ```

    ```plaintext
    Retrieve snippet1 and apply to NewFile.cs
    ```
1. When prompted to run the tool, consent by clicking **Continue**

1. When you're done, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window to stop the `func.exe` host process.

### MCP Inspector

1. In a **new terminal window**, install and run MCP Inspector

    ```shell
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
    ```

1. CTRL click to load the MCP Inspector web app from the URL displayed by the app (e.g. http://0.0.0.0:5173/#resources)
1. Set the transport type to `SSE` 
1. Set the URL to your running Function app's SSE endpoint and **Connect**:
    ```shell
    http://0.0.0.0:7071/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse
    ```
1. **List Tools**.  Click on a tool and **Run Tool**.  

## Deploy to Azure for Remote MCP

Run this [azd](https://aka.ms/azd) command to provision the function app, with any required Azure resources, and deploy your code:

```shell
azd up
```

You can opt-in to a VNet being used in the sample. To do so, do this before `azd up`

```bash
azd env set VNET_ENABLED true
```

Additionally, [API Management]() can be used for improved security and policies over your MCP Server, and [App Service built-in authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization) can be used to set up your favorite OAuth provider including Entra.  

## Connect to your *remote() MCP server function app from a client

Your client will need a key in order to invoke the new hosted SSE endpoint, which will be of the form `https://<funcappname>.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse`. The hosted function requires a system key by default which can be obtained from the [portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/function-keys-how-to?tabs=azure-portal) or the CLI (`az functionapp keys list --resource-group <resource_group> --name <function_app_name>`). Obtain the system key named `mcp_extension`.

### Connect to remote MCP server in MCP Inspector
For MCP Inspector, you can include the key in the URL: 
```plaintext
https://<funcappname>.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse?code=<your-mcp-extension-system-key>
```

### Connect to remote MCP server in VS Code - GitHub Copilot
For GitHub Copilot within VS Code, you should instead set the key as the `x-functions-key` header in `mcp.json`, and you would just use `https://<funcappname>.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse` for the URL. The following example uses an input and will prompt you to provide the key when you start the server from VS Code.  Note [mcp.json]() has already been included in this repo and will be picked up by VS Code.  Click Start on the server to be prompted for values including `functionapp-name` (in your /.azure/*/.env file) and `functions-mcp-extension-system-key` which can be obtained from CLI command above or API Keys in the portal for the Function App.  

```json
{
    "inputs": [
        {
            "type": "promptString",
            "id": "functions-mcp-extension-system-key",
            "description": "Azure Functions MCP Extension System Key",
            "password": true
        },
        {
            "type": "promptString",
            "id": "functionapp-name",
            "description": "Azure Functions App Name"
        }
    ],
    "servers": {
        "remote-mcp-function": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "https://${input:functionapp-name}.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse",
            "headers": {
                "x-functions-key": "${input:functions-mcp-extension-system-key}"
            }
        },
        "local-mcp-function": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "http://0.0.0.0:7071/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse"
        }
    }
}
```

Click Start on the server to be prompted for values including `functionapp-name` (in your /.azure/*/.env file) and `functions-mcp-extension-system-key` which can be obtained from CLI command above or API Keys in the portal for the Function App.

## Redeploy your code

You can run the `azd up` command as many times as you need to both provision your Azure resources and deploy code updates to your function app.

>[!NOTE]
>Deployed code files are always overwritten by the latest deployment package.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your function app and related resources, you can use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure and avoid incurring any further costs:

```shell
azd down
```
